# Etch A Sketch

A simple web-based Etch A Sketch built with HTML, CSS (Flexbox), and JavaScript.
The page displays a grid of squares that change color when hovered, creating a drawing effect.
Users can also click a button to generate a new grid with a custom number of squares per side (up to 100).
